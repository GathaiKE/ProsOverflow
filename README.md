This is a site that mimics the basic operatons of stack overflow where users can sign up and ask questions, answer questions, review answers to their questions and even give feedback on how the answers were helpful. The user can also set the most insightful answer to their question as the preffered answer to help other users who might come searching the site for simiklar problems.

The technologies used in this project were SQL Server for the database, Node, express, Angular for the front end and NgRx for state management.
